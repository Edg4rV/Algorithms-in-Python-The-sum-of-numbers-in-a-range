# Algorithms-in-Python-The-sum-of-numbers-in-a-range
Your task here is to implement a simple algorithm that counts the sum of those numbers from a list that belong to a specified range.

Input: the first line contains a list of integer numbers separated by spaces. The second line contains two integer numbers aa and bb such that a \le ba≤b. The numbers are separated by a space as well. They represent the range.

Output: the sum of all elements xx of the list such that a \le x \le ba≤x≤b. If the list doesn't contain elements belonging to the specified range, output 00. See the example for more details.

Sample Input 1:

5 1 3 4 2
2 4
Sample Output 1:

9
Sample Input 2:

4 5 1 3 8
4 6
Sample Output 2:
